## Welcome to My Neovim Setup!

This repository houses my personal and ever-evolving Neovim configuration. I created it primarily for two reasons:

1.  **For others:** To share my setup with anyone who is interested and finds it useful.
2.  **For myself:** To maintain a synchronized and version-controlled backup of my environment.

Feel free to explore, fork, or draw inspiration from it for your own ideal setup.
